<h1>A/B Hypothesis_testing</h1>
This repo consists of codes and notebooks that can be used for classical A/B Hypothesis investigation and Machine Learning approaches to A/B testing.
The machine learning algorithm implemented in this study are: Logistic regression, Decision Trees and Xgboost
A 5 fold validation was used in a grid search to tune the hyperparameters of the algorithms.
